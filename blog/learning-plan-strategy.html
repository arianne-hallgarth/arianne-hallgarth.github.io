        <h4>I looked back at my learning plan and here are my takeaways:</h4>
        <p> I am open to growth mindset but currently has fixed mindset, but since our brain has the power to stretch and grow, it gave me more sense of security that through constant practice and determination, I'm gonna be able to achieve my long term goal of becoming confident with coding. <br> With regards to my softskills, I would have to continue what I am doing, facing my fears, I realize the pattern of awkwardness when I start something and the fear of what's coming. I would have to work on those. I have read during my research that confidence comes from practice, being reminded that everyone started from nothing until we practice something and become effcient with it. So I guess the key is just to keep going and to feed the brain. <br> Time management is one thing that I guess I have to work really hard on, but with confidence I think it will come together, I feel pressured putting the time on right now I guess I'll start with asking questions whenever I feel stucked, that way I will be able to practice dealing with time and be more efficient and accomplish more. <br></p>
