      <div class="explain">
      <h2><em>JavaScript, HTML and CSS Relationship</em></h2>
      <p> 
        Think of a house, The house by itself is the HTML, If you describe a house generally, you'd say it has its components like, roof, stairs, windows, rooms(bedroom, kitchen, lounge, toilet, bathroom), It will serve its purpose as a shelter. Now consider CSS as personalizing a house, making it unique with all its properties, like how many rooms? how big? how small? what color? how dim? how sturdy? Now, the functionalities inside the house takes the same role as the javascript, like how the light is turning on, the automations and all. I hope it made sense. So HTML - as the structure, CSS as the properties of the structure, it's responsible for the aesthetics and Javascript for functionalities. Combined together, they create great result or product. </p>

      <h2><em>Control Flow and Loops</em></h2>
      <p> 
        Control flow and loops is like 
        This are conditions set for programs to execute certain tasks. Just like any process, you are given a set of conditions to follow in order to achieve a certain result to a certain point. Let's say in a manufacturing company, the machines are given a set of instructions or step by step procedure. 
        <br>
        <em>Real life Examples:</em>
        <br><em>"for loop:"</em> For every morning, monday to friday: Cook breakfast.
        <br><em>"while loop:"</em> While laundry is going, vacuum the floor/carpet. 
        <br><em>"if/else if loop:"</em> If condiments, certain food or toiletries are gone, list for this weeks grocery, else if  condiments, certain food or toiletries are almost out of stocks list for next weeks grocery else don't list.
        <br><em>"for each:"</em> for each plate, put this amount of pasta and sauce.

      <h2><em>The DOM</em></h2>
      <p> 
      I am not so sure about this one, so far I think of this as a construction mockups, which is a representation/model that allows you to create change or remove elements from the document. By far this is the most confusing part for me.

      <div class="explain">
        <h2><em>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</em></h2>
        <p> 
        They are both used to access group of data. Real Life example: If you are to do a farming business, if you were to find a cow you can either have them fall in line(Array) and get it base on position, take note to start the counting from zero[0] though just cause its programming counting, or mark them with a number tag(object) to try and find that specific cow.

        <div class="explain">
          <h2><em>Function and its use</em></h2>
          <p> 
          How I think of a function is like a variable, you can call it whenever you need to display its function or the result of what is inside it. In real life, I'd like to think of it as a menu in a restaurant. Ingredients are stored and are readily available for when you order it.
