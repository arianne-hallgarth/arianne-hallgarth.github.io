      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      > I have been traumatised a lot since I was a child and there was this one situation that kept haunting me especially when I am going through a difficult situation. I had been suffering through it for years and it has finally gotten the worse out of me last year. So I have decided to face it and have informed the person involved which is my mom. She didn't take it seriously and it made the situation worse. We weren't speaking for more than three months until I found out that she had a difficult situation. I coulnt help but get worried despite what happened so I have decided to approach her so we were fine until father's day. She has made another scene, it got to tiring to a point that this time I stood up and tried to talk sense to her which ofcourse made the situation worse as she wouldn't take it. I am well aware that it never turned out good when she's on the bad side. I have opened up the unresolved past and she told me that she would never apologize to me. I am well aware of that and just used that as an example to make a point. I think both times challenged my ethical views. This time though, I have realized that no matter how badly you wanted to save someone, you can only do so much and there should be a limitation to it. So this time I am choosing myself and would like to pick myself up, build a good, happy and contented life and move on from the past tragic situations that I had. I know it's not gonna be easy but it will be worth it.
      
      CORE - Identity, Values and Strengths
      
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
      It's a stash of good and bad. Lately I have been realizing a lot when it comes to values. Being in a different country has made me re-evaluate the values that I have learned growing up. I have always found it hard to accept the culture of not being able to share your opinion on literally anything as old people always knows better especially moms. I have always been careful of the things that I say that I have never been comfortable to share my piece on literally anything. I have always learnt to bow down, can't joke around people, I have always felt awkward. On the other side I am quite happy of the way I respect people, when at the same time well aware that I am giving way too much than what other people deserves. This is gonna be a novel if I keep going so I'll simply put it this way. I am trying to see through things, re-evaluate and reshape my self to be a better person now that I am on a stage where I am wanting to be better and am able to do so without the same amount of fear of criticism.
      
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
      Honestly skipped this core due to my strengths crashing away due to underlying cause. But let me think it as if it's a normal day with a normal situation. I'd say my strengths are:
      Patience: I am patient figuring out things and am happy seeing results of my hardwork.
      Resourceful: I research when I dont understand things, which also turns to be my weakness cause I try to squeeze as much as I could somewhere else before asking questions wanting to find things out myself.
      Eagerness: My eagerness I think has always been my strength. I am eager to succeed that I am able to use it to not give up easily despite the circumstances. 
      
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      I am re-evaluating it lately. I honestly feels scared that I might not be able to successfully finish this course due to my personal situation. But I am trying my best to fight it as I badly want to move forward. I am really hoping that I won't end up quiting study or moving it later as it is important for me to move forward the soonest I could.
      
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      I always find it hard to work productively with my mom as she always wants things done her way. She always criticizes the way I do things and gives me sarcastic remarks from simple things to complicated ones. I have reacted differently over the years. I used to not do anything at home with the fear of being shout out or criticized, and she keeps on making me feel guilty about it. So I tried doing things and as expected she always has her critical remarks. I tried to assess why I dont feel comfortable when she gives her remarks and found out that its her way of delivering things, so I am trying to take the good things out of it. Sometimes I try to let her know that I am trying to improve and expect her criticism to come next which happens as expected most of the time, and remind myself to take myself out of it. That's just the way she is and I can't really do much about it. So Im working on focusing on what I can do to improve myself and to not focus so much on what I can do to please her.
