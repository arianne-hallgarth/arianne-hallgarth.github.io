      CORE - Identity, Values and Strengths
      
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
      It's a stash of good and bad. Lately I have been realizing a lot when it comes to values. Being in a different country has made me re-evaluate the values that I have learned growing up. I have always found it hard to accept the culture of not being able to share your opinion on literally anything as old people always knows better especially moms. I have always been careful of the things that I say that I have never been comfortable to share my piece on literally anything. I have always learnt to bow down, can't joke around people, I have always felt awkward. On the other side I am quite happy of the way I respect people, when at the same time well aware that I am giving way too much than what other people deserves. This is gonna be a novel if I keep going so I'll simply put it this way. I am trying to see through things, re-evaluate and reshape my self to be a better person now that I am on a stage where I am wanting to be better and am able to do so without the same amount of fear of criticism.
      
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
      Honestly skipped this core due to my strengths crashing away due to underlying cause. But let me think it as if it's a normal day with a normal situation. I'd say my strengths are:
      Patience: I am patient figuring out things and am happy seeing results of my hardwork.
      Resourceful: I research when I dont understand things, which also turns to be my weakness cause I try to squeeze as much as I could somewhere else before asking questions wanting to find things out myself.
      Eagerness: My eagerness I think has always been my strength. I am eager to succeed that I am able to use it to not give up easily despite the circumstances. 
      
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      I am re-evaluating it lately. I honestly feels scared that I might not be able to successfully finish this course due to my personal situation. But I am trying my best to fight it as I badly want to move forward. I am really hoping that I won't end up quiting study or moving it later as it is important for me to move forward the soonest I could.
      
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      I always find it hard to work productively with my mom as she always wants things done her way. She always criticizes the way I do things and gives me sarcastic remarks from simple things to complicated ones. I have reacted differently over the years. I used to not do anything at home with the fear of being shout out or criticized, and she keeps on making me feel guilty about it. So I tried doing things and as expected she always has her critical remarks. I tried to assess why I dont feel comfortable when she gives her remarks and found out that its her way of delivering things, so I am trying to take the good things out of it. Sometimes I try to let her know that I am trying to improve and expect her criticism to come next which happens as expected most of the time, and remind myself to take myself out of it. That's just the way she is and I can't really do much about it. So Im working on focusing on what I can do to improve myself and to not focus so much on what I can do to please her.
