      <h3><em>Cultural Influences:</em></h3>
      <p>
        It's a stash of good and bad. Lately I have been realizing a lot when it
        comes to values. Being in a different country has made me re-evaluate
        the values that I have learned growing up. I have always found it hard
        to accept the culture of not being able to share your opinion on
        literally anything as old people always knows better especially moms. I
        have always been careful of the things that I say that I have never been
        comfortable to share my piece on literally anything. I have always
        learnt to bow down, can't joke around people, I have always felt
        awkward. On the other side I am quite happy of the way I respect people,
        when at the same time well aware that I am giving way too much than what
        other people deserves. This is gonna be a novel if I keep going so I'll
        simply put it this way. I am trying to see through things, re-evaluate
        and reshape my self to be a better person now that I am on a stage where
        I am wanting to be better and am able to do so without the same amount
        of fear of criticism.

      <h3><em>My armour stash:</em></h3>
      <p>
        <em>Patience:</em> I am patient figuring out things and am happy seeing
        results of my hardwork. <br /><em>Resourceful:</em> I research when I
        dont understand things, which also turns to be my weakness cause I try
        to squeeze as much as I could somewhere else before asking questions
        wanting to find things out myself. <br /><em>Eagerness:</em> My
        eagerness I think has always been my strength. I am eager to succeed
        that I am able to use it to not give up easily despite the
        circumstances.

      <h3><em>Limitations:</em></h3>
      <p>
        I am re-evaluating it lately. I honestly feels scared that I might not
        be able to successfully finish this course due to my personal situation.
        But I am trying my best to fight it as I badly want to move forward. I
        am really hoping that I won't end up quiting study or moving it later as
        it is important for me to move forward the soonest I could.

      <h3><em>Cautious Collaboration:</em></h3>
      <p>
        I always find it hard to work productively with my mom as she always
        wants things done her way. She always criticizes the way I do things and
        gives me sarcastic remarks from simple things to complicated ones. I
        have reacted differently over the years. I used to not do anything at
        home with the fear of being shout out or criticized, and she keeps on
        making me feel guilty about it. So I tried doing things and as expected
        she always has her critical remarks. I tried to assess why I dont feel
        comfortable when she gives her remarks and found out that its her way of
        delivering things, so I am trying to take the good things out of it.
        Sometimes I try to let her know that I am trying to improve and expect
        her criticism to come next which happens as expected most of the time,
        and remind myself to take myself out of it. That's just the way she is
        and I can't really do much about it. So Im working on focusing on what I
        can do to improve myself and to not focus so much on what I can do to
        please her. When we need to work together, I try to focus on what I can
        instead of focusing on the criticism.
