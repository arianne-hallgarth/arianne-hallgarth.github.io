        <h3><em>Neuroplasticity</em></h3>
      
      <div class="explain">
        <h4><em>What is it?</em></h4>
        <p><em>"Neuroplasticity"</em>refers to the brain’s malleability, or nerve cells’ ability to adapt and change their characteristics. 
          <dl>
          <dt>There are two main types of neuroplasticity:</dt>
          <dd>Functional plasticity is the brain’s ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas. </dd>
          <dd>Structural plasticity is the brain’s ability to change its physical structure due to learning.</dd>
          </dl>
          </p>
      </div>
          <br>
        <div class="explain">
        <h4><em>How does this phenomenon work?</em></h4>
          A child’s brain grows rapidly during the first few years of life. A neuron in the cerebral cortex has 2,500 synapses—small gaps between neurons that relay nerve impulses—at birth. By the age of three, this number has grown to a total of 15,000 synapses per neuron.
          <br>Adults, on the other hand, have only about half that number of synapses. As we gain new experiences and grow, some neural connections are strengthened while others are eliminated. This process is known as synaptic pruning.
          <br>Neurons that are used frequently develop stronger connections and remain in the brain. Those that are rarely or never used eventually die. By developing new connections and pruning away weak ones, the brain can adapt to its changing environment.</p>

      <div class="explain">
      <h4>Why neuroplasticity is relevant</h4>
        <p><em>"Increasing Intelligence"</em>
          <br>
          In 2008, a groundbreaking study discovered that intelligence is fluid and can be increased with the proper stimulus. Since then, scientists have changed their fundamental view that human intelligence could not be improved. 
          <br>
          One example is London cab drivers, who must memorize over 320 main routes, 25,000 streets, and 20,000 landmarks for a geography test called “The Knowledge.” Researchers were curious to see what happened to their brains over 3-4 years of studying. They found that the hippocampus, the part of the brain dealing with memory, grew tremendously in size over this time. 
          <br>
          Moreover, many children are led to believe that intelligence and other talents are fixed traits rather than cultivable abilities. However, research has shown that when students are taught about brain plasticity and how their intelligence is not fixed, it makes a dramatic impact on their morale. It can even help kids raise their IQs. Through the simple understanding that they had the potential to get smarter and do better in school, they did.
