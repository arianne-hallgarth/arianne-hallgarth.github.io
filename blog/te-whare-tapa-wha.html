        <h4><em>Here is my wellbeing plan base on Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa Whā model.</em></h4><br>
        <h4><em>Taha Tinana</em>- Physical Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>For my personal well being: My plan is to go to the gym atleast 3x a week. <br> Go back on eating low carbs. And try to go back in a healthy sleep cycle to also be ready for bootcamp.</p>
        <h4><em>Taha Whānau</em>- Family Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>For my family well being, I will find time to connect to people that make me feel like home, my husband, siblings, relatives and friends.</p>
        <h4><em>Taha Hinengaro</em>- Emotional and Mental Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>For my emotional and mental well being: I will practice and remind myself of the growth-mindset. <br>I will keep a journal to be able to express myself freely without the need for affirmation from anyone.</p>
        <h4><em>Taha Wairua</em>- Spiritual Wellbeing</h4>
        <p>For my spiritual well-being. I would find time to be able to go to church and discipleships and read the bible even just for a short period each day.</p>
        <h4><em>Whenua</em>- Interconnections to the land and environment</h4>
        <p>For my whenua well being, I would continue to connect with nature and try to be more connected by taking time to listen, smell and feel nature apart from my normal visual appreciation.</p>
