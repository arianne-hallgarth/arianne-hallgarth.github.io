         <dd>I am way too confident in using this that it's not healthy at all. This is me at the moment, I think I have to use less of this as it usually throws me into a rabbit hole.</dd>

         <dd>I used this with my husband, it helped a lot during the time where I couldn't get my brain to function even with the simple paragraph, it unblocks a mentally blocked mind.

         <dd>This is me, it's just that so far, everything is a bit much, too much infos, then the time that I need to catch up to. I started friends with google and ended up not wanting to ask for his help. Google is good so long as you got time to find things out.</dd>

         <dd>This has been harder and harder for me, seeing my peers flying through the course makes me retreat asking questions, I do a little strategy of scrolling back for a possibility that someone asked the same question, sometimes there are some answered questions similar to mine, my lucky moments!</dd>

         <dt><em>Asking coaches for help</em></dt>
         <dd>I am currently practicing this, was hard at first cause I feel like every steps needs questions. But I have no choice now cause I am drowning with catch ups! So yeah I try to ask questions no matter how annoying it may sound.</dd>

    <h3><em>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</em></h3>
    <p>
      I am very reluctant to ask questions because I am always behind since sprint 2 and its gotten worse and worse. I have an ongoing situation that makes my whole system down time and time again especially when given difficult situations. So far, I am in a stop, dance rhytm, I dance fast when I know my system is functioning and stop when my system shuts down. I am surprised I am now writing this and am about to start another sprint with my not so reliable mind state.
