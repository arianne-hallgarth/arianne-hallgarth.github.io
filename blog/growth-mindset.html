        <h4><em>What is it and why is it relevant?</em></h4>
        <p>A <em>"Growth Mindset"</em> means that you thrive on challenge, and don’t see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities. Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to growth. It is important to know this as this will combat the old belief that you can just do so much and that you are wired as you are. Learning about growth mindset could actually make you strive more to achieve more.</p>
      
          <p><em>8 ways to develop a growth mindset:</em></p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Listen to the mindset voice inside of you.</dt>
            <dt>Recognize that you have a choice.</dt>
            <dt>Talk back with a growth mindset voice.</dt>
            <dt>Practice.</dt>
            <dt>Find outside help.</dt>
            <dt>Stop seeking approval of others.</dt>
            <dt>Replace the word “failing” with “learning.”</dt>
            <dt>Take growth mindset action.</dt>

        <h4><em>Exploration: Changes/Surprise</em></h4>
        
         <p>If anything, it made me realize things. When I was a kid, I have always been told that I am a slow learner, I have always felt that it was the truth. But then I came to a point where I just wanna strive to be better even if I know it might take me more effort as I am not a fast learner. <br> Learning about growth mindset made a lot of sense, in order for you to be better, you have to work harder, even if people are wired differently, it doesnt mean that you can't train your brain to do better. It gave me a sense of relief and boosted my confidence that I can do better if I keep on trying and practicing what I learn.</p>

      <h4>Why neuroplasticity is relevant</h4>
        <p><em>"Increasing Intelligence"</em>
          <br>
          In 2008, a groundbreaking study discovered that intelligence is fluid and can be increased with the proper stimulus. Since then, scientists have changed their fundamental view that human intelligence could not be improved. 
          <br>
          One example is London cab drivers, who must memorize over 320 main routes, 25,000 streets, and 20,000 landmarks for a geography test called “The Knowledge.” Researchers were curious to see what happened to their brains over 3-4 years of studying. They found that the hippocampus, the part of the brain dealing with memory, grew tremendously in size over this time. 
          <br>
          Moreover, many children are led to believe that intelligence and other talents are fixed traits rather than cultivable abilities. However, research has shown that when students are taught about brain plasticity and how their intelligence is not fixed, it makes a dramatic impact on their morale. It can even help kids raise their IQs. Through the simple understanding that they had the potential to get smarter and do better in school, they did.
