        <h3> Learning: <em>Strengths and Limitations</em>:</h3>
        <p> My eagerness to succeed this time around could be counted as my <em>Strength</em>. Giving a chance to prove myself that I can achieve great things, face my dreams and turn them into reality through facing my fears, practicing as much as I could and re-focusing on achieving something rather than settling on my <em>"what-ifs"</em>.
          <br><em>Limitations?</em> I am currently trying to improve my ability to handle emotions when dealing with difficult situations as it came to a point where it affects important things that I do and love.

        <h3> <em>Soft-Skills</em> to Unlock: </h3>
        <em>There are powerful skills that I know I must possess in order to succeed not just at school/ work but in life generally.</em> Here are some of those:
        <p><em>"Resilience"</em> - Resilience is one of the most important skill not just for school and work but in life. There are a lot of things that has happened over the years that has caused my resilience to break down. I am currently working to build it back up as I know it is a very powerful and important skill that a person must possess.
        <br><em>"Confidence"</em> - I have a very low confidence level and have already made some progress over the years but am well aware that I need to improve it more.
        <br><em>"Time management"</em> - I am not very good with time management I get pressured when I put a timer on literally everything but cooking.

        <h3> <em>Commitments</em> to manage <em>workload</em>: </h3>
        <p><em>To manage myself to work productively</em>I am working on my confidence to ask questions and collaborate more effectively with other students. 
        <br>I am looking for different ways to keep myself grounded when things are building up.</p>

      <div class="explain">
        <h3> <em>Grounding Essentials</em>: </h3>
        <p><em>"Breathe"</em> - This is a technique that I need to re-master. I used to be able to do this effortlessly. But now I freak out over the simplest things.
        <br><em>"Re-assess"</em> - Whenever I am freaking out over new things I tend to get lost only to find out that it's not as frustrating as I make it sound.
        <br><em>"Seek Help"</em> - Seeking help when needed, whether externally or internally.

      <h3> <em>Expectations:</em> </h3>
      <p> I am not big on this. I am used to being made believe that expectations are set on me as a student. I suppose please know that I am not really used to this kind of learning program, so please be patient with me. I'm not trying to be a pain, it's just me and my not so confident self.
