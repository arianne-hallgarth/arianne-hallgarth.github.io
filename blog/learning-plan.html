        <h3> Learning: <em>Strengths and Limitations</em>:</h3>
        <p> My eagerness to succeed this time around could be counted as my <em>Strength</em>. Giving a chance to prove myself that I can achieve great things, face my dreams and turn them into reality through facing my fears, practicing as much as I could and re-focusing on achieving something rather than settling on my <em>"what-ifs"</em>.
          <br><em>Limitations?</em> I am currently trying to improve my ability to handle emotions when dealing with difficult situations as it came to a point where it affects important things that I do and love.

        <h3> <em>Soft-Skills</em> to Unlock: <br> </h3>
        <em>There are powerful skills that I know I must possess in order to succeed not just at school/ work but in life generally.</em> Here are some of those:
        <p><em>"Resilience"</em> - Resilience is one of the most important skill not just for school and work but in life. There are a lot of things that has happened over the years that has caused my resilience to break down. I am currently working to build it back up as I know it is a very powerful and important skill that a person must possess.
          <br><em>"Confidence"</em> - I have a very low confidence level and have already made some progress over the years but am well aware that I need to improve it more.
          <br><em>"Time management"</em> - I am not very good with time management I get pressured when I put a timer on literally everything but cooking.

         <p><em>To manage myself to work productively</em>I am working on my confidence to ask questions and collaborate more effectively with other students. 
          <br>I am looking for different ways to keep myself grounded when things are building up.</p>

> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
- This is a very timely question to ask as I am currently at a point where things are building up due to the difficult time that I am currently facing and my lack of knowledge as I am currently behind the sprint. I am currently communicating with Joseph our human skills facilitator. It is not an easy thing to do but I am using my eagerness to succeed in this journey as my weapon to keep going.

A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
> I don't know honestly. I haven't attended bootcamp before. I just really took a chance and hoped its gonna be something for me. I guess for them to be patient enough when I finally find my courage to ask questions cause I feel like I'll be asking heaps.

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
> I shouldn't think so. Oh! actually, there is one but I havent really signed up yet due to the busy schedule we have here. November 18-19, they're weekends but I'm not sure how busy it would be so I can't commit yet.
