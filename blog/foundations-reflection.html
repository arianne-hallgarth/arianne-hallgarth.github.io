        <h4><em>What surprised me the most about learning core?</em></h4>
        <p> That it is very important to becoming a successful individual, you gotta not neglect your softskills because it is what's gonna lead you to your goals. And the good news is that our brain is adaptable, we just have to be patient and kind with ourselves. It is of great importance not just the techy stuffs.</p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</em></h4>
            <p>> I have to work on believing in myself. <br>
              > I expect too much from myself. <br>
              > I can do things i didn't think I could.</p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em></h4>
            <p> Values, empathy and self-awareness are all valuable not just in learning and programming but in life. They affect the way you learn and adapt, good thing is that it can be changed. Self awareness is they key. And always be teachable.</p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em></h4>
            <p> The pace of the course was too fast for me and I haven't really thought I'm gonna make it through due to all the things happening in the background, core learning helped me out a lot. Finding out the strengths I don't think I have and being more confident about the changes that can happen if you keep on training yourself.</p>   
        <br>  
        <h4><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em></h4>
            <p>The most challenging aspect that I have encountered are time constraints and difficult times. It is very easy to bypass core to be able to focus on technical stuffs, and difficult times makes me too furious to loosen up which is what core does. 
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</em></h4>
        <p>Because it is one of the best tools in programming, it is very vital in succeeding in life. I really appreciate having core in this program as it is what pushed me to keep going. Made me realise a lot of things when it comes to progress. I shouldn't think I'll be able to reach this point if not for the help of the core.</p>

            <h3> My <em>Long Term</em> Goal?</h3>
            <p> To learn programming until I become proficiently comfortable enough to create great projects. I wanna be able to create outputs that's gonna make great impact in the industry. I wanna be able to land a programming job after the course.

            <h3> Learning: <em>Strengths and Limitations</em>:</h3>
            <p> My strengths is my eagerness to keep going even if the circustances makes it difficult to keep going. Limitation is probably still my lack of technical skills but I believe now that through time and practice it will get better.

            <p><em>To manage myself to work productively</em>I am working on my confidence to ask questions and collaborate more effectively with other students. 
            <br>I am looking for different ways to keep myself grounded when things are building up.</p>

            <h3> <em>Grounding Essentials</em>: </h3>
            <p><em>"Breathe"</em> - This is a technique that I need to re-master. I used to be able to do this effortlessly. But now I freak out over the simplest things.
            <br><em>"Re-assess"</em> - Whenever I am freaking out over new things I tend to get lost only to find out that it's not as frustrating as I make it sound.
            <br><em>"Seek Help"</em> - Seeking help when needed, whether externally or internally.

          <p> My expectaions are still the same, and I can see that facilitators are very much open to questions. I think I'm in a good spot on this.

          <br> I didn't commit to this. 
          <br> I suppose my commitment is to give myself some me time without feeling too bad.
